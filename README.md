# Dataquest Project Solutions

This repository is a series of notebooks that show solutions for the [projects](https://www.dataquest.io/apply) at [Dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/).

Of course, there are always going to be multiple ways to solve any one problem, so these notebooks just show one possible solution.
